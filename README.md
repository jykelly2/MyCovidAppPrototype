# About

***

This prototype design is an application for COVID-19 App. The motivation of the app is to inform and update user about the coronavirus and to also prevent user from getting infected by the virus through the user tracker alert system. Main features include informing user about symptoms, prevention techniques, overall statistics and as well as funding which allows users to make contributions to help fight the coronavirus by donating through non profit oranizations. We also have an account based system with a phone number and also with notification and location permission setting so we could notify the user thorught the app or by mobile phone number of any near by alert of positive case.
