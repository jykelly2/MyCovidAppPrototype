# MyCovidAppPrototype

## About

***

This prototype design is an application for COVID-19 App. The motivation of the app is to inform and update user about the coronavirus and to also prevent user from getting infected by the virus through the user tracker alert system. Main features include informing user about symptoms, prevention techniques, overall statistics and as well as funding which allows users to make contributions to help fight the coronavirus by donating through non profit oranizations. We also have an account based system with a phone number and also with notification and location permission setting so we could notify the user thorught the app or by mobile phone number of any near by alert of positive case.

## New features to include in the future

***

1.	Daily self-check by filling out information such as temperature, physical health etc. to keep track of the user's health.

2.	Recommendations for all possible cases depending on the user's health determined from daily self-check. For example, if a user has dry cough and slight fever, recommend user to filter out the air in the room and keep monitoring the temperature. If temperature stays above certain degrees for some time, go contact hospital and ask for emergency.

3.	Provide call center help as well as information about the nearest hospital (how busy it is, is testing available, drive through test etc.).

4.	Inform user through news feed as well and gather all news resources related to COVID-19. Have search or filter feature to filter out news.

5.	Chat feature to inform each other about coronavirus and to bring local communities together. Users can inform each other of nearby positive case, mask and medical information, places to avoid etc. in order to keep each other informed and safe.
